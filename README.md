# TempConvert_Version1
This was a fun project, converting fahrenheit, celsius, and kelvin.

This is the first version I worked on, just a simple tool with 3 conversions. 
I later worked with a group of people to add more conversions and better visuals. 
This is just a cute little starter for the code framework.
